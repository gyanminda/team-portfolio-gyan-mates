            We are a family of four who loves travelling and always go on unplanned trips. Sometimes I feel like I must be really lucky to be born to them because I can share anything and everything to them. They treat me as their best friend  and that’s how they are. </p>
 <p>I would actually say, my Dad is the coolest. He is very much hardworking and he loves to drive and travel as well. He never lets his problem hit us and does every little thing to make us happy and takes us to explore almost every place. He shows what is love by the way he cares for us. </p>
 <p>Each one of us must have got inspired and wondered by someone. In my story, it’s always my Mom. Yes, she is an Astrologer  by profession  and she keeps developing on  it as her passion. She is a mother of two, yet she never stops to keep herself growing and also taking us grow with her. She takes care of the family along with her job and moreover she is doing her Ph.D. in her passion. I wonder how she manages all these but you know the fact that MOM is always MOM. </p> 
 <p>I’ve a cute little brother who is 8 years younger than me. As my parents are working, it was me who raised him, most of the time. Lol, I feel like a responsible person and a caring sister for him. He is so naughty that we have no day without annoying and fighting with each other yet it feels bored without doing those.</p>

            There are many things in this world that we can achieve with our talent, skills, power and wealth but there are few things in our life for which we are totally dependent on luck and blessings of God, one such thing is Good Friendship.
        </p>

            These people are the pearls of my life, who I can rely upon whatever happens. My college would have been real bore if I wasn't with them. As we were all good at studies, we used to bunk classes and roam here and there. Those were the tiny happy moments we get each day.
        </p>
        <p>
            My college life with them has been so epic that it's literally impossible to choose a single moment, but here I'm gonna jot down one such beautiful moment - it was 26th Jan 2019,  the last day of our first industrial visit. We were all together for dinner on the same table having so much fun, we had so much laughter and deep conversations too. I literally cried at the end that "  I didn't want this day to end!" I will never forget that day in my entire life.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now as the college is going to get over soon, we are all worried, we won't be able to see eachother everyday and all will be separated really far from one another. That's how deep our friendship is.❤️

                    Ever since I was little, I've loved animals, especially Dogs❤️. There was always a beautiful connection between me and them. Since we travel a lot and live in an apartment, we are not able to get one. But I've a group of innocent souls who waits for me in the evening while I return from the college. That happiness I get after feeding them cannot be described.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed love towards dogs because of my aunt, she loves dogs and has two. Whenever I visit her place, I'll be with her dogs playing and cuddling them. Now it is my dream to own 3-4 dogs. I'm sure I'll be the happiest one on earth when I see my babies running around the house.

                    When I was a little kid, my mom was out of town for a few days and I watched my dad cook for me. I used to help him in the kitchen and that's how I got this love for Cooking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love experimenting while cooking, by watching YouTube videos and trying out in my own way. There's nothing wrong with a little bit of experimentation while cooking as long as what you make is edible. Whether I cook for my family, friends or just myself, I just enjoy it watching how those veggies, meat and spices combine to give those appetizing flavours. And when I get those good comments about food, I feel proud, overjoyed and this motivates me to cook even better the next time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cooking relaxes and calms my mind, whenever I feel stressed, I cook to soothe my mind. I've this dream of setting up my own Cafe in the future once I become financially independent.

                It all started after I won a dance competition in my upper kindergarten, my dad after watching me dance, decided to join me in a dance school at the age of 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learnt classical dance, i.e. Bharatanatyam for 8 years and Mohiniyattam for a year. But I couldn't continue it as I went to a residential school for my higher secondary. I wish it had never ended but I know I can start it once again in the future.
