                <p><h1>ABOUT</h1><br>Hey, First of all I welcome you to my personal blog, Myself Aravindh Ramanathan and my friends call me as Ramu .
                    I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering in Sri Eshwar College of Engineering. I did my 
                    schooling in Bharathiya Vidya Mandir which is located in Pollachi with the Aggregation of 93% in 10th grade and 86% in 12th grade. 
                    I was born on February 12th, 2000 in Pudukottai and hence it is my Hometown. But in behalf of work my parents settled in Pollachi 
                    right from my childhood and I haven’t got enough number of chances to go to my hometown because of long distance journey from my 
                    place. So I am very much excited whenever my parents started to say that “we are moving to our hometown this weekend” and I am a 
                    typical gallivanter kind of person and I always wish to travel to many adventurous places in my life. I love to drive vehicles and 
                    I learnt to drive at the early stages of life. But the sad truth is I haven’t taken my Driving License (DL) yet in my life.i wish 
                    I will be taking it as soon as possible and reposting this blog again.

            <div class="hobbies" id="tag-hobbies">
                <p><h1>HOBBIES</h1><br>My hobbies are playing Sudoku and surfing through the internet. The interest for playing Sudoku started at 
                    7th standard. Actually our school conducts an interschool competition every year. So each and every student should enrol their 
                    names in any one of the events. So I gone for enrolling to the dance competition and my friends had already enrolled in the 
                    music competition and since I have decided in the last minute of the event registration, there are no vacancies in the dance 
                    competition.so no other way I should enrol for any one event, so I checked in the event list and I enrolled in the Sudoku 
                    competition without having any awareness of the event. The organizer told us the rules of the Sudoku puzzle and it was so go to 
                    hear the rules of the game and unfortunately I can’t finish it within the given time.so on the same day evening I went to home and 
                    started practising the puzzle again. Hence it started there and till now I am solving it with great passion and interest. I can 
                    confidently say I am a pro in Sudoku solving now.
